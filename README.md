In addition, make sure to also install the [zxing Barcode scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android), which is used for scanning QR codes, and the [Google Drive App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs), which is used for data persistence.
